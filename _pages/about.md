I am a passionate and results-driven **Data Scientist** with a strong interest in **machine learning, predictive modeling, and data-driven decision-making**. My journey started with a **B.Sc. in Mathematics**, where I developed a deep understanding of statistical analysis and algorithm design, and later pursued an **M.Sc. in Data Science**, refining my expertise in **artificial intelligence, machine learning and forecasting**. 

Currently, I am working as a **Consultant at KPMG**, where I have been analyzing complex datasets, advising on data strategies, and delivering actionable insights for diverse clients. However, my true passion lies in building **innovative machine learning models** that transform raw data into meaningful, impactful solutions.  

Professional Focus  
------
- **Data-driven decision making**: supporting strategic initiatives with analytics and AI.  
- **Machine Learning & Deep Learning**: building and deploying predictive models for real-world applications.  
- **Statistical analysis & data manipulation**: leveraging mathematical techniques to extract insights from data.  
- **Sports Analytics**: developing soccer models (as done for personal projects), blending my love for sports and Data Science.  

Personal Interests 
------
When I‚Äôm not working on data science projects, you can find me:  
- Practicing **sports**, I love staying active through sports like **skiing**, **boxing**, **padel**, and **soccer**.  
- Spending time with my **dog**, who never fails to remind me of the importance of taking breaks.  
- Playing **skill-based** or **strategy-based** games (Skull, No Thanks, Chess,...), where I enjoy applying strategic thinking.  
- Having dinner with friends while **watching soccer games**.
- Exploring new technologies, as I'm always eager to learn, experiment with cutting-edge tools and acquire, if any, certifications.
